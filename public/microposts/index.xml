      <description>Most hobbies that I take up seem to have a hidden element in them: They are about escaping control. Building a home server: Making sure I control my own 1s and 0s.</description>

      <description>I watched the documentary From Here to InFinite on Deep Purple while flying over Greenland. What I liked most was how Steve Morse looked during rehearsal and recording sessions when taking in advice from the producer.</description>

      <description>From the sublime &amp;ldquo;Empire Ants&amp;rdquo;:
 The falling of the whole empire is here to hold you Rolling out and haunted till it sinks
 The little Village Green Preservation Society gems on Plastic Beach are snippets of world-building, plastic enough to fit into many different molds and stories.</description>
