From the sublime "Empire Ants":

> The falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you \
Rolling out and haunted till it sinks

A lyric that's been on my mind a lot lately in the face of human behavior so antithetical to our continuance on such massive scales. Progress is such a silly word, sometimes.
