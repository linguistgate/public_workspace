I watched the documentary _From Here to Infinite_ on Deep Purple while flying over Greenland. What I liked most was how Steve Morse looked during rehearsal and recording sessions when taking in advice from the producer. Aged fingers curled over the fretboard, eyes cast to the floor, a surprisingly large giant of intense contemplation.
