Most hobbies that I take up seem to have a hidden element in them: They are about escaping control. Building a home server: Making sure I control my own 1s and 0s. Writing: Ensuring that I can create alternative spaces of being into which no one gets to peer unless I choose. Drawing: Construing reality according to my own eyes. I wonder how generalizable this insight is, including to hobbies that one would normally consider volunteer work.
