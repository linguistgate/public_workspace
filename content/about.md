I am an educator and writer interested in digital humanities, linguistics, and farming. I like fizzy water, maps, and long hikes. One of my dreams is to have a small self-sufficient farmstead with bee-keeping, various fermentation capabilities (kimchi and Czech pilseners), and an <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/">antilibrary</a>.

Currently, I teach within the High Tech High system of charter schools in San Diego. A long-term goal is to introduce linguistics courses to the high school setting. I believe that literacy is improved by studying language as a social and psychological object. In addition, appreciating and embracing linguistic difference (such as accent and dialect) make us more open-minded and empathetic human beings. I'm agnostic about whether linguistics is a "science," finding the debate to be a form of gatekeeping more often than not, but I firmly believe the analytical tools of the sciences  are helpful in understanding how some aspects of language work.

My educational background is in linguistics (Ph.D. and M.A., Stanford University) and German (M.A., Georgetown University). I graduated _summa cum laude_ from the University of California, Irvine, and studied German language and literature at Göttingen.

_The title of my public web presence, Phantisocracy, refers to the utopian ideal set forth by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey in the 1790s. Their pantisocratic ideals were never concretely realized. A phantisocracy is my term of art for any utopian scheme that remains hypothetical._
