Waking up in France, I often feel like I am covered in a different kind of dust. My dreams are different. My body expects different foods.

It has been an utterly strange two years. We are supposed to normalize a detestable man because he supposedly speaks up for our version of the British Labour man. But he doesn't speak for them. He lies. He is just as much a part of Hayekian neoliberal death trap as his "crooked" opponents. With each creeping day, he savages normalcy, deliberative practice, the primacy of experts, and ever-evolving democratic frameworks that are flawed but lovable and damn necessary. Inequality widens, but we are collectively too scared to say so (or some of us welcome it, but that requires the famous "Trump lean-in" rather than gross admission).

Waking up in France, pulled away from diurnal worries and mismatched expectations, I have time to think. Much of it is full of beautiful things. Projects I want to undertake, writings I want to begin, languages I want to study, plants I want to grow, mountain paths I want to explore.

I don't know what the future holds, but I do how to dream interpretation. I see a view of mountains, my workflow intact, my writing, my books, my wife puttering around with me. And there ain't anything evil about that.
