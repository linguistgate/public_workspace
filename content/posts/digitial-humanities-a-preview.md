Over the past year, I've grown increasingly attracted to the idea of
teaching a digital humanities course in a secondary education
environment. I have three reasons for this:

1. Humanities-based education remains vitally important and must not
   fall by the wayside. We should be expanding humanities offerings and
   reinvigorating programs, not creating _a false and ultimately harmful
   dichotomy between STEM and the liberal arts_. Digital humanities is
   but one of many ways to _keep humanistic inquiry fresh and relevant_.
2. Digital humanities allows students to practice quantitative and
   algorithmic skills (math and programming) in an environment
   traditionally divorced from the quantitative and solely aligned with
   the qualitative. Working in a digital humanities paradigm allows
   students to practice both qualitative and quantitative analysis, each
   important in its own way, applied to literature, writing, history, or
   art. _Digital humanities promotes flexible learners at an
   appropriately earlier age._
3. I believe that digital humanities can shed new light on age-old
   humanistic questions, and it also provides a means to _uncover new
   literatures, new voices, and new communities_. Promoting this kind of
   education is vitally important in a massively interconnected world.
